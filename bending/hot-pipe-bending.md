# Hot pipe bending


## Design

- Up to 5mm thick. Ideally 2 - 3mm. Note that thicker requires more patience to slowly bend things
- Material shapes
  - Flat strips work
  - Round doesn't work very well
    - Needs to be thin, and it will probably bruise at the contact point
  - Elliptical works better than round
  - Don't use for parts that may get wet. Hot pipe bend items may return to their original shape
    when they get wet for extended periods of time

## Preparation

- Spray bottle with water to be able to constantly soak the wood
- Create a jig for the inside of your bend, that can be used later to keep the piece in the
  desired shape while it dries.
  - If using MDF make sure to coat it so that it doesn't absorb water
- Use a propane burner


## Timber selection

-

## Jig

- Block of wood, about 20mm thick
- Plumbing pipe, ideally steel. Size of pipe determines how tight of a bend you can make
- Gasket between wood and pipe. High temperature capable!
  - This gasket keeps the wood from burning, so get a good one
- Cut a slot in the top, 3 - 5mm wide. This is where you can keep a template for comparisons


## Pre-soak

- Soak for 30mins to 3 hours, no more, otherwise wood may lose structure

## Bending

- Make sure to keep timber damp so it doesn't burn
- Keep it moving, even in roation motion around the pipe
- Can be backed up with a strap for less tearing. But make sure to keep strap off pipe
- Pipe temperature should be warm but when sprayed with water it shouldn't sizzle

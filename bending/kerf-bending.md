# Kerf bending

## Preparation

- Cuts 6 - 8mm between cuts, the exact amount depends on radius that needs to be bend
  - Fewer cuts if you can get away with it
- Leave 3mm at bottom, watch the type of saw blade


## Construction

- Needs veneer on the top and bottom to hold shape
  - If you put multiple layers of kerf material together they need veneer between them,
    otherwise there is no glue surface
- If you want to cover up the kerf then you can steam bend a strip of material
  - Leave the strip oversize
  - Keep in mind that you want the middle of the cover strip to match the middle of the piece, thus
    you need to adjust the jig to have the right curvature, in general this means you need a slightly
    less high jig
    - If you have a cover on it, then you can remove the cover of the jig, which should give you
      3mm extra

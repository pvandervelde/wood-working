# Laminating

## Design

## Preparation

- Before starting to cut put a marker on the block so that you can work out
  how the strips go back together, that way you can keep the grain similar
- Laminating strips need to be less than 3mm (ideally 1 - 2mm)
  - Set bandsaw about 1/2mm over, and then use planer to clean up
- Joint the block after each cut, the strips need to be run through the planer
- The strips need to be smooth so that there is good glue contact
- Grain direction matters


## Timber selection

- Bendy ply is a thing
  - It'll need to have veneer applied to both sides to keep its shape

## Jig

- Either use
  - a male/female jig setup
    - Note that the jigs need to take into account the thickness of the work piece
  - A stack of 3mm MDF strips / sheets. You'll need at least 8, but more for
    bends that don't have enough clamp space
    - The MDF strips distribute the clamping pressure in a 45 degree cone
- The jig needs to be smooth and accurate because the thin laminate material
  will follow all the bumps
- Put tape or a layer of thin tape or something slick on the jig to stop glue
  from attaching to it

## Pre-soak

## Bending

## Curing

- Ensure clamping pressure is well spread out to remove all cavities
- Can use salt (a tiny sprinkle) to stop things from moving
  - Note that if you're bending laminates, then they should be able to move relative to each

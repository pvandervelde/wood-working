# Steam bending

## Design

- Steam bend wood tends to either open or (more likely) close over time
  - This means it cannot be unsupported over large distance

## Preparation

- Put centerlines everywhere
- Get a strap that is as high as the piece, otherwise it'll deform
  - Veritas sells straps and strap components
  - Handles might need to be made. Get a timber that is sturdy like Ash
  - Make sure the handles are big enough for multiple people

## Timber selection

- Wood needs to be rectangular, higher than it is wide
- Bend hardwoods, not softwoods
  - Oak
  - Silver beech
  - Maple (doesn't really like it)
  - Cherry
- If the grain runs out of the piece of timber in a shorter space than 150mm it is probably
  not going to work. Straight grain is better


## Jig

- Create a jig from MDF, the jig surface doesn't have to be super perfect
- Coat the jig in a thing layer of expoxy or other waterproofing agent so that the
  moisture from the part doesn't go in the jig
- Write on the jig:
  - what it is for
  - which size timber it is for

## Pre-soak

- Kiln dried timber should be pre-soaked for 24 hours and then wrapped with
  glad-wrap before it gets put in the steambox

## Steaming

- In the steambox for 1 hour for every 25mm of thickness
- Note on the timber when it went into the steambox, so that you know how long it's been
  in there for



## Bending

- The bigger the thickness the bigger the bending forces
  - Make sure everything is attached properly!!
- Blemishes should be on the strap side, because those are supported
- if the piece is less high than the strap make sure it's in the middle
- When on the form ensure that the piece and the strap touch the bottom board
  - If it doesn't, hit it with a hammer and a block of wood until it does

## Drying

- On the initial jig for at least as long as it's been in the steambox
- After it's been on the form take the clamps off, remove the end clamps last
  - Remove the tension from the strap before removing the last clamps
- After it comes of the initial jig put it on a shaped drying rack that supports the bend
  - Dry it for at least a few days, ideally 1 or 2 weeks
  - clamp the ends and the middle
  - Make sure it goes straight over the drying rack, otherwise it'll deform
- Always dry slowly (especially for oak because otherwise it surface checks)
  - If it is warm outside cover it with a blanket
  - Dry inside a building where the temperature is constant

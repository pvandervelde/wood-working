# Veneer

## When to use

- When using veneer, always apply it to both sides, otherwise the piece will warp
- Ideally use veneer with MDF because MDF doesn't move
- If using solid wood in the piece use thin strips of no more than 5mm, otherwise
  it will start to move / warp
  - Make sure there is enough timber for later processing without hitting the
    veneer, otherwise it'll be ugly

## Preparation

- Put centerlines on everything (jig, material etc.) so that you can align things
  and know when things are misaligned during construction
- Workspace
  - Clear the workspace
  - Get clamps etc. ready to go
  - Create the laminate stack in the correct order
  - Verify that everything is correct
  - Unwind the stack in the way you want to put glue on the faces
  - Apply enough glue but don't overglue

## Applying

- Never put glue on the veneer, it will swell immediately
- Use a coversheet between the veneer and the pressure device (clamps / vacuum bag etc.)

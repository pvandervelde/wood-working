# Band saw

## Blade

- 1/2 inch, 3tpi skip tooth - Generally the only blade you need

## Tooling

- Have short push sticks
- Put a magnet in the push stick so you can stick them to the band saw cover
- Write on the push stick which tool they belong to.

## True-ing up

- Center of the blade should be in the center of the wheel
- You can correct a little bit with the wheel tilt
- Don't set the tention too high. You are more likely to to set it to high,
  rather than too low


## Setup

- Anagram: Big Fish Go Deep
  - Blade - Ready to go
  - Fence - Set up
  - Guard - Down as far as possible
  - Dust extraction - On and working
- Measure distance from fence to the inward pointing tooth, i.e. the one that points
  to the fence
- When moving the fence in small increments tap where the fence attaches, otherwise
  it may rack
- Probably cut a test piece.

If there is no attached fence

- Set up a fence, roughly correct
- Saw some MDF
  - Check the cut while it's on the machine, you should see the shadow of the teeth on
    both sides of the timber

## Sawing

- Cut slowly
- Use the back of the blade as a guide by gently twisting the piece of timber into
  the back of the blade and using that as a rotation point. Don't push too hard
  because that bends the blade
- Single hand drive, that way you're not constantly correcting
- Keep hands / fingers at least 75mm away from blade, switch to pulling if necessary
- Use push sticks in cases where you need to

## After care

- Keep the offcuts, they can be used as sanding blocks for the final piece by using sandpaper on
  the edge where the bandsaw made a cut
